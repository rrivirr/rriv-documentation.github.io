# Methane and Carbon Dioxide Case

Case specifically for use with the Figaro NGM2611-E13, Adafruit DHT22, and AtlasScientific EZO-CO2 sensor.  Which informs the sensor plate, cable glands, and power supply (length of case and nylon bar).
[TODO: If we removed / generalized the sensor plate and cable glands requirements / instructions this could generally be for a 12" elongated case]: #

## Build Process

### Tools & Skills

- [Horizontal/Vertical Metal Cutting Band Saw](https://www.harborfreight.com/horizontal-vertical-metal-cutting-bandsaw-93762.html) to cut steel threaded rod to length 
- [Reed TC4QP Tubing Cutter for plastic pipe](https://www.reedmfgco.com/en/products/plastic-pipe-tools/quick-release-tubing-cutters-for-plastic-pipe/tc4qp/) to cut ABS to length
- 2x [9/16 SAE combination wrench](https://www.mcmaster.com/56255A34/) for hex nuts
- [Milwaukee 6in Diagonal Cutting Pliers](https://www.milwaukeetool.com/Products/Hand-Tools/Pliers/Diagonal-Cutters/48-22-6106) for copper mesh and cable ties
- Measuring tape
- #2 phillips head screw driver / drill bit

### Parts Fabrication

- Cut steel threaded rod into 6 parts of 18" length
- Cut ABS to 2x 1-21/32" length, 1x 11" length for the hub inserts and main housing section. When making hub inserts, 20/32 to 22/32 is acceptable, too little won't hold the o-ring in place, too much won't compress the o-ring enough to seal properly
- Mark placement of battery holder screw placements on Nylon bar
- Drill 3/32" pilot holes into nylon bar (for #6 screws) according to battery holder placement centered on bar, then screw battery holder into nylon bar
- Cut 20" of copper mesh
- Attach both cable glands through their respective holes in acrylic sensor plate

### Assembly & Waterproofing

1. Add cable glands to sensor plate
2. Insert ABS __ length into one end of each coupling, then __ length in between
3. Add O-Rings around ABS
4. Add nuts & washers to rods
5. Add plates & housing to rods
6. Insert nylon bar into housing
8. Wrap copper mesh around sensor cage and use cable ties to hold in place
